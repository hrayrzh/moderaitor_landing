Last updated: February 2026
1. About moderAItor
moderAItor is an AI-based hate speech detection and content analysis tool designed to support media organizations and civil society organizations in moderating publicly available comments on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
moderAItor functions as a technical decision-support tool. Media organizations and authorized users remain responsible for defining and applying their own moderation policies, as well as for taking final moderation decisions in accordance with applicable platform rules and standards.
2. Scope of Data Processing
moderAItor processes only content and information that is publicly available in accordance with the terms, policies, and privacy settings of the relevant platform.
This may include:
? public comments and replies,
? platform-provided user identifiers,
? timestamps and limited engagement-related metadata.
moderAItor does not access private messages, private profiles, closed or restricted groups, or any content limited by platform privacy settings.
3. Purpose and Function
Data is processed solely for the purpose of:
? identifying and classifying hate speech and other harmful or policy-violating content,
? flagging content for review by authorized moderators,
? supporting moderation workflows using native tools provided by the respective platform.
moderAItor does not independently publish, amplify, suppress, or remove content and does not bypass platform safeguards, enforcement systems, or appeal mechanisms. All moderation actions are taken by authorized users in accordance with their moderation policies and the applicable platform rules. 

In some cases, content may be temporarily hidden according to the moderation policy of the organization using the platform, until a final human review and decision are made. All final moderation actions remain the responsibility of human teams.
4. AI Processing and Human Oversight
moderAItor uses artificial intelligence to analyze publicly available content in order to detect patterns that may indicate hate speech or other prohibited content.
The system operates with human-in-the-loop oversight and does not rely solely on automated decision-making. moderAItor does not produce automated decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on individuals.
5. Legal Basis for Processing
Data processing is carried out on the basis of legitimate interest in combating hate speech, supporting safer online environments, and enabling responsible media and civil society moderation practices.
Where data is processed for research or system improvement purposes, appropriate safeguards, such as anonymization and aggregation, are applied. Processing is conducted in accordance with applicable data-protection legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Law on Personal Data Protection of the Republic of Armenia.
6. Data Retention
Data is retained only for the period necessary to support moderation workflows, analytical functions, research activities, and system improvement.
Retention practices follow the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. Stored data is periodically reviewed and deleted or anonymized when it is no longer required, unless retention is necessary to comply with legal obligations.
7. Data Sharing and Disclosure
moderAItor does not sell, rent, or commercialize personal data.
Access to processed data is restricted to authorized users. Data may be shared only:
? in aggregated or anonymized form for research, reporting, or transparency purposes, or
? where disclosure is required by law or by a competent public authority.
8. Platform Policy Compliance
moderAItor is designed to operate in compliance with the Community Standards, Content Policies, and Developer Policies of Meta and YouTube.
The tool does not replace platform enforcement actions, appeal mechanisms, or user rights provided by those platforms.
9. Security Measures
Appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect processed data against unauthorized access, alteration, loss, or misuse, taking into account the nature of the data and the associated risks.
10. Rights of Data Subjects
Where applicable under data-protection law, individuals have the right to request access to their personal data, request correction or deletion, or object to certain types of processing.
Requests for data deletion or anonymization are handled in accordance with moderAItor’s Data Deletion Instructions. Requests related to content visibility, enforcement actions, or account-level measures must be addressed directly to the relevant platform.
