moderAItor is an AI-based content analysis and hate speech detection tool designed to assist media organizations and civil society organizations in monitoring publicly available comments on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
The service provides automated classification and flagging of content to support human moderation decisions. moderAItor functions as a decision-support tool and does not replace human judgment, platform-level enforcement mechanisms, or appeal processes. moderAItor does not perform platform-level enforcement, account-level actions, or automated sanctions against users.

You remain responsible for ensuring that your use of the service complies with the terms and policies of Meta, YouTube, and any other connected platform.
5. Moderation Actions
